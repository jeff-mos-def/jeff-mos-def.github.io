**Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)** is a collaborative software development approach where acceptance test criteria are defined before development begins. It ensures alignment between [[stakeholder.md | stakeholders]], developers, and testers by focusing on the expected behavior of the system.

## Key Aspects of ATDD
- **Collaboration-Driven** – Involves developers, testers, and business stakeholders to define test cases before implementation.
- **Requirement Validation** – Ensures that acceptance tests align with business and user expectations.
- **Early Defect Detection** – Identifies issues at the requirement stage, reducing costly fixes later.
- **Improves Test Coverage** – Facilitates the creation of comprehensive test cases that directly reflect requirements.

## ATDD Workflow
1. **Define Acceptance Criteria** – Stakeholders and teams define clear, testable acceptance criteria.
2. **Write Acceptance Tests** – Test cases are created based on the defined criteria.
3. **Develop Code** – Developers write code that meets the predefined tests.
4. **Run Tests** – Automated or manual tests are executed to validate functionality.
5. **Refactor & Improve** – Code is refined until all acceptance tests pass.

## Example of ATDD in Practice

### Scenario: User Login System
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - The user must enter a valid email and password.  
  - The system must return an authentication response within two seconds.  
  - If credentials are incorrect, an error message must be displayed.

- **Acceptance Test (Before Development):**  
  - Given a registered user with valid credentials  
  - When they enter their email and password  
  - Then they should successfully log in and be redirected to their dashboard.

- **Development & Testing:**  
  - Code is implemented to satisfy the acceptance test.  
  - Tests are executed, and the feature is refined until all tests pass.

## Why ATDD Matters
- **Aligns Development with Business Goals** – Ensures that software meets real-world needs.
- **Enhances Collaboration** – Encourages shared understanding between business and technical teams.
- **Reduces Rework** – Catches issues early, preventing costly fixes later in the development cycle.
- **Supports Agile & DevOps** – Fits seamlessly into iterative development and continuous testing practices.
